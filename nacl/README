The buildsystem has been altered to use waf.

On linux and OS X, this should be straightforward:
./waf configure build

On windows, you might want to do:
CC=i686-pc-mingw32-gcc CXX=i686-pc-mingw32-g++ ./waf configure build

To cross-compile for android (from linux), you might want to do:
./helpbuild-android /path/to/android-ndk-r6

An attempt has been made to build nacl under emscripten, but the result did not
appear to work.  (Note: the elimination stage had to be skipped because of
memory exhaustion.)  Most specifically, signature creation seemed to go into an
infinite loop.  See the node.js bindings for the unit test logic.  You can
try and do emscripten builds by doing:
./helpbuild-emscripten /path/to/emscripten
