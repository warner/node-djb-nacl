# === Build DJB NaCl ===
#
# nacl has its own build system, "do".  In a good news/bad news situation, "do"
#  benchmarks all implementations on your machine and picks the one that's
#  fastest and makes sure it produces valid results.  Unfortunately, this makes
#  it very slow.  Other bad news is that it seems to be biased towards the
#  assumption that the source code was perfect as it arrived and so fails to
#  report compilation errors.  This matters when you are trying to fix bugs
#  in the implementation and would like to see the compiler failures you may
#  have caused rather than have to guess why the given object file did not show
#  up in the library. (nb: The only encountered bug has been in the C++
#  binding.)
#
# The general structure of the source tree in do's nomenclature is:
#   operation/primitive/implementation
#  where:
#  - operation is one of the directories named in the OPERATIONS file on its
#     own line.  For example: crypto_box, crypto_stream, etc.
#  - primitive is the algorithm that is used to that end: salsa20, etc.
#  - implementation is the name of an implementation that implements that
#     primitive.  For example: ref, donna_c64, etc.
#
# In the operation directories, besides the sub-directories, we may also find:
#  - measure.c: Performmance measurement of the primitives.
#  - try.c: Unit tests.
#  - wrapper-*.cpp: C++ wrappers
#
# In the primitive directories, we may find files like:
#  - selected: Indicates that this is the default primitive to use for the given
#     operation and that the relevant header glue should be generated.
#  - used: Indicates that the primitive should be available to the library and
#     so should be built.  It just may not be the "selected" primitive.
#  - checksum: Something to do with running the try.c tests; dunno right now.
#
# There are also a few directories with their own special build logic we care
#  about:
#   - randombytes: the .c file needs to be built and the header renamed
#   - inttypes: It detects the right size by doubling the number for the
#      appropriate number of bits (signed versus unsigned) and generating the
#      appropriate header files.  Instead, we manually created some header
#      files that just include stdint.h and perform a typedef.
#  and some we do not care about:
#   - cpuid
#   - okcompilers
#   - cpucycles
# 
# **THE BIGGEST ANNOYANCE WITH DO** is that it builds every implementation with
#  the global "crypto_OP.h" header file pretending that the currently building
#  implementation is the selected primitive and implementation in question (with
#  the resulting #defines to boot.)  Since "do" builds each implementation
#  individually and is constantly creating and destroying stuff, this is
#  reasonable for it, but is annoying for a build system that tries to
#  parallelize things.  We deal with this by mutating the source files so that
#  '#include "OP.h"' becomes '#include "IMPL_PRIM_OP.h" which lives
#  in a private "build-include" directory.
#
# We are using waf here because node uses it.  We are using the 1.6 series
#  instead of the out-of-date 1.5 series because the API docs for 1.6 are
#  readily available.  We aren't using make because we are trying to decrease
#  the pain going on and I like that waf colorizes by default.
